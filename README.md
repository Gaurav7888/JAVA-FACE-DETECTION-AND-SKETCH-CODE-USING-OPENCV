# JAVA FACE DETECTION AND SKETCH CODE USING OPENCV


OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. In this project we will use java instead of python which is otherwise conventionally used with OpenCV 

The project is divided into two parts:
    - First part is to convert normal images to sketch images.
    - Second part is to detect multiple faces. 

## Requirements

- OpenCV.
- Java(any latest vesion will be fine).
